first goal: get project display working (even if ugly)


1. maybe make this mvc (knockout? static?)
- will use knockout, jquery, bootstrap
- add in compliation and web site optimization

2. will not make site super-fancy, rather use it to show who i am (average, adaptable programmer)

3.

What I need:
-link to major project highlights (nano deg, touchpoint)
-link to git hub
-link to linked in
-contact link (pcguy e-mail)
-skill highlights
-30-second speech
